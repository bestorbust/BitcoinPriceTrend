#  Stock Trend Prediction with GRU Models

Welcome to the Stock Trend Prediction repository! This repository provides a full-stack implementation of a stock trend prediction system using deep learning, specifically **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)** neural networks. The system includes data preprocessing, model training (GRU, LSTM, CNN, Transformer), batch prediction, and a web-based prediction interface using Flask.

##  Introduction

Stock market prediction involves forecasting the future trends of stock prices. Due to the highly dynamic and non-linear nature of the stock market, traditional models often fail to provide accurate predictions. This project leverages the strength of **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, particularly **GRU**, which is well-suited for sequential data like time-series stock data.

This repository is a complete solution that:
- Preprocesses stock data from multiple financial platforms
- Trains and evaluates deep learning models
- Provides trend predictions via a web application
- Supports historical batch predictions and real-time forecast

## ðŸ“‹ Project Description

This project includes the following key modules:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans raw data, handles missing values, and performs feature engineering (Daily %, VWAP, Turnover, etc.).
- **Model Training**: Supports GRU, LSTM, CNN, Transformer architectures with early stopping and RMSE evaluation.
- **Batch Prediction**: Predicts stock trends across full datasets and outputs summarized results.
- **Flask Web App**: Lightweight interface for trend prediction based on a user-input date.

##  Usage Examples

### Predicting Trend for a Specific Date
```python
from gru_predict import get_gru_trend_for_date

trend = get_gru_trend_for_date("2025-04-10")
print(f"Predicted trend: {trend}")
```

### Training a GRU Model on a Specific Dataset
```python
from train import create_gru, run_pipeline

results = run_pipeline("data/processed_ds1.csv")
```
